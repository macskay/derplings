## Running the Game

Only python 3.6 or newer is supported.

* For linux, you need to make sure you have the python-dev packages available to build the wheel for planar
* For windows, a binary dependencies are available in the bindeps folder
* For Mac OS. Gee we sure hope this works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Use pip to install the dependencies in requirements.txt (as seen below)

then run

    python run_game.py

### Running the Game in a Virtual Environment

Make sure you create an environment with python >= 3.6. Then run

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

then

    python run_game.py


## How to Play the Game

Your goal is to get as many derplings you can to the top of the tower where they can parachute to safety. Use the items to help the derplings ascend the tower.

1. Left click on an item to place it
2. Right click to get out of item placement mode
3. Right click on placed items in the map to return them to your inventory
4. Don't let the derplings fall too far or they will explode
